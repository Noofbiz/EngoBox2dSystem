# engoBox2dSystem
Physics, Collision, and Mouse systems for the Engo game engine that utilizes ByteArena's box2d Go port

This is a set of systems for use with the [Engo](https://engo.io/) game engine.

To use, make sure Engo is working first. Then you'll need the go port of [box2d](https://github.com/ByteArena/box2d). Then you can run

```
go get github.com/Noofbiz/engoBox2dSystem
```

Check out the demos to see what you can do. They're currently a work in progress, so check back later for more!

To Do:

[]Finish demos
